In 1848, Stringfellow achieved the first powered flight using an unmanned 10 feet (3.0 m) wingspan steam-powered monoplane built in a disused lace factory in Chard, Somerset. Employing two contra-rotating propellers on the first attempt, made indoors, the machine flew ten feet before becoming destabilised, damaging the craft. The second attempt was more successful, the machine leaving a guidewire to fly freely, achieving thirty yards of straight and level powered flight. Francis Herbert Wenham presented the first paper to the newly formed Aeronautical Society (later the Royal Aeronautical Society), On Aerial Locomotion. He advanced Cayley's work on cambered wings, making important findings. To test his ideas, from 1858 he had constructed several gliders, both manned and unmanned, and with up to five stacked wings.

This reduces the need for shaving, plucking, and other hair removal techniques that lead to ingrown hairs.  Laser hair removal is relatively safe, and the side effects (typically redness and irritation) are usually mild and temporary. In rare cases, permanent scarring may occur.

Unlike the facts of Pettitt v. Fresno, there was\nno mere \u201cmistake\u201d by a local zoning official. The Ortiz Family relied on fully issued permits,\nand on the First Encroachment Agreement fully executed by the City. The City thereafter\nunilaterally terminated those approvals without a hearing.\nThe equal protection laws generally provide that the government should treat an\nindividual in the same manner as others in similar conditions and circumstances.\nIf the Ortiz Family are now denied their New Encroachment Permit, they would be\n\u201csingled out\u201d for such denial and enforcement action.

Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated.\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship and is contributing to elevated global uncertainty. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.\n\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\n\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\n\nVoting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Patrick Harker; Philip N. Jefferson; Neel Kashkari; Lorie K. Logan; and Christopher J. Waller.\nThe title of above article can be:", "output_text": "The Federal Reserve Raises Interest Rates to 4.5% to Fight Inflation\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by 75 basis points, the largest increase since 1994, in an effort to combat inflation that is running at its highest level in 40 years.\n\nThe Fed's decision was widely expected, as policymakers have been signaling for weeks that they were prepared to take aggressive action to bring inflation under control. The central bank's target for the federal funds rate, which is the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loans, is now in a range of 4.5% to 4.75%.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the rate hike, the Fed said that it \"expects to continue to raise rates until inflation is back to its 2% objective.\" The Fed also said that it would begin to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, which it has been buying since the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nThe Fed's decision is likely to have a significant impact on the economy. Higher interest rates will make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money, which could lead to slower economic growth. Higher interest rates will also make it more expensive for consumers to borrow money, which could lead to slower spending.\n\nThe Fed's decision is also likely to have a significant impact on the stock market. Higher interest rates make stocks less attractive to investors, as they can earn a higher return on their money by investing in bonds or other fixed-income securities.\n\nThe Fed's decision is a sign that policymakers are serious about fighting inflation. However, it is unclear whether the Fed's actions will be enough to bring inflation under control. Inflation is being driven by a number of factors, including supply chain disruptions, the war in Ukraine, and strong demand for goods and services. It is possible that the Fed will need to raise interest rates even higher in order to bring inflation under control.\n\nThe Fed's decision is a risky one. Higher interest rates could lead to a recession. However, the Fed believes that it is necessary to take action to fight inflation, even if it means risking a recession."}
