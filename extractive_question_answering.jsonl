{"input_text": "Background:\nIn the visual arts, the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered. However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the Cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this \"renaissance\" of Norman art and scholarship were Mont-Saint-Michel, F\u00e9camp, Jumi\u00e8ges, Bec, Saint-Ouen, Saint-Evroul, and Saint-Wandrille. These centres were in contact with the so-called \"Winchester school\", which channeled a pure Carolingian artistic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.\nQ: When did the church reform begin?\nA:", "output_text": "early 11th century"}

{"input_text": "Background:\nYellowstone National Park is an American national park located in the western United States, largely in the northwest corner of Wyoming and extending into Montana and Idaho. It was established by the 42nd U.S. Congress with the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular. While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.\nQ: Which national park is the first national park in the US?\nA:", "output_text": "Yellowstone"}
{"input_text": "Background:\nThe benefits of electric kitchens go beyond climate impact, starting with speed. The first time I ever cooked on induction (electric) equipment, the biggest surprise was just how incredibly fast it is. In fact, induction boils water twice as fast as traditional gas equipment and is far more efficient \u2014 because unlike a flame, electric heat has nowhere to escape.

{"input_text": "Background:\nNOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING: PROPOSED CHANGES TO POTABLE/DRINKING WATER RATES On June 7, 2022, at 1:30 p.m., the San Jos\u00e9 City Council will conduct a public hearing on proposed changes to the SJMWS potable water rates and charges. The hearing will be held at the City Council Chambers, 200 East Santa Clara Street, San Jos\u00e9, California 95113. Discussion on rates will occur when the matter can be heard after the start of the meeting. City Council meetings may be conducted either virtually, via in-person public attendance, or both. Go to the following URL: www.sanjoseca.gov/news-stories/watch-a-meeting for information on participating at a City Council meeting. At the hearing, the City will be proposing potable rates, water meter charges, zone charges, and private fire line charges (collectively \u201cWater Rates\u201d) starting fiscal year 2022-23 (July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023). Water Rates are paid by residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Proposed Water Rates and sample bill calculations are on the following pages. Reason for the Proposed Update SJMWS provides an average of 15 million gallons of drinking water per day to residences and businesses in the service areas of Alviso, North San Jos\u00e9, Evergreen, Edenvale, and Coyote Valley. The system includes pipelines, pump stations, fire hydrants, storage reservoirs, wells, and water meters, as well as facilities required to comply with all state and federal drinking water standards. Changes to Water Rates are primarily related to the projected increased cost of wholesale water, personnel costs, and drought-related impacts on the water supply and usage. Additional, smaller changes to costs of operating and maintaining the system include site security and other minor infrastructure improvements. The Water Rates have two charges: those to recover fixed costs (meter charges) and variable costs (quantity rates). Customers will continue to be billed a flat service charge based on the size of the water meter (Table 1), as well as a quantity charge per unit of water used (Table 2). The proposed quantity rates reflect the cost to supply water to customers within each service area and within elevation zones in the Evergreen/Edenvale service area. Customers with a dedicated fire service will also pay flat service charges as shown in Table 3. The Water Rates reflect the projected costs of providing water service to specific customer classes and service areas. Proposed quantity rates include one rate for each service area/zone, which reflects the difference in the costs of wholesale water provided to each service area. Proposed meter charges reflect the costs of service to each meter class.\nQ: What date is the hearing on proposed changes to the SJMWS potable water rates and changes?\nA:", "output_text": "The hearing on proposed changes to the SJMWS potable water rates and changes will be held on June 7, 2022, at 1:30 p.m. at the City Council Chambers, 200 East Santa Clara Street, San Jos\u00e9, California 95113."}
{"input_text": "Background:\nThe Osborne 1 is considered the first true mobile computer by most historians. Adam Osborne founded Osborne Computer and produced the Osborne 1 in 1981. The Osborne 1 had a five-inch screen, incorporating a modem port, two floppy drives, and a large collection of bundled software applications. An aftermarket battery pack was available. The computer company was a failure and did not last for very long. Although it was large and heavy compared to today's laptops, with a tiny 5\" CRT monitor, it had a near-revolutionary impact on business, as professionals were able to take their computer and data with them for the first time. This and other \"luggables\" were inspired by what was probably the first portable computer, the Xerox NoteTaker. The Osborne was about the size of a portable sewing machine, and could be carried on commercial aircraft. The Osborne 1 weighs close to 11 kg (24 lb) and was priced at US$1,795 (equivalent to $5,350 in 2021).\nQ: Why was the Osborne 1 considered having a near-revelutionary impact on business?\nA:", "output_text": "professionals were able to take their computer and data with them for the first time"}

{"input_text": "Background:\nThere is evidence that there have been significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation. Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleo lakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.\nQ: What does LGM stands for?\nA:", "output_text": "Last Glacial Maximum."}

{"input_text": "Background:\nGames such as chess, poker, Go, and many video games have always been fertile ground for AI research. Diplomacy is a seven-player game of negotiation and alliance formation, played on an old map of Europe partitioned into provinces, where each player controls multiple units (rules of Diplomacy). In the standard version of the game, called Press Diplomacy, each turn includes a negotiation phase, after which all players reveal their chosen moves simultaneously. \nThe heart of Diplomacy is the negotiation phase, where players try to agree on their next moves. For example, one unit may support another unit, allowing it to overcome resistance by other units, as illustrated here:\nComputational approaches to Diplomacy have been researched since the 1980s, many of which were explored on a simpler version of the game called No-Press Diplomacy, where strategic communication between players is not allowed.
