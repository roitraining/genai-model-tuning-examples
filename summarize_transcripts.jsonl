{"input_text": "Provide a summary with about two sentences for the following article:\nOur quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated fashion that we call quantum algorithms. The challenge is that qubits are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors \u2014 and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow. This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today. To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction. Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a \u201clogical qubit,\u201d and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations. Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.\nSummary:", "output_text": "Quantum computers are sensitive to errors, which worsen as the size of the computer increases.

This includes learning how to properly fit your boot on your foot, understand the different functions of the ski, and bring gloves, goggles etc. Your instructor starts you with one-footed ski drills. Stepping side-to-side, forward-and-backward, making snow angels while keeping your ski flat to the ground, and gliding with the foot not attached to a ski up for several seconds. Then you can put on both skis and get used to doing them with two skis on at once. Next, before going down the hill, you must first learn how to walk on the flat ground and up small hills through two methods, known as side stepping and herringbone. Now it\u2019s time to get skiing! For your first attempted run, you will use the skills you just learned on walking up the hill, to go down a small five foot vertical straight run, in which you will naturally stop on the flat ground. This makes you learn the proper athletic stance to balance and get you used to going down the hill in a safe, controlled setting. What do you need next? To be able to stop yourself. Here, your coach will teach you how to turn your skis into a wedge, also commonly referred to as a pizza, by rotating legs inward and pushing out on the heels. Once learned, you practice a gliding wedge down a small hill where you gradually come to a stop on the flat ground thanks to your wedge.

Generally, adhesive hooks that can hold up to 16 pounds (7.3 kg) should work.  You'll need 2 adhesive hooks per pair of curtains you want to hang up. You can find adhesive hooks online or at your local hardware store. Since you'll be using 2 adhesive hooks, each hook only needs to hold half of the weight of your curtains. For example, if your curtains and curtain rod weigh 32 pounds (15 kg) in total, you would need 2 adhesive hooks that can hold up to 16 pounds (7.3 kg) each. Many adhesive hook brands have stylized versions, made with steel or wood rather than plastic. Opt for these varieties if the aesthetic of your curtains is important to you. Draw a square at least 2 in (5.1 cm) wide in the corner of the piece of cardboard. Then, cut it out with scissors to create a right angle. You'll use the piece of cardboard with the right angle in the corner to mark where you want to hang up your adhesive hooks so they're level with each other. The corner of the window should be aligned with the right angle you cut out of the cardboard. Hold one of the adhesive hooks over the cardboard where you want to hang it, and mark the bottom of it on the cardboard with a pencil. Keep the cardboard aligned with the corner of the window while you puncture it with the pencil. You want the mark on the wall to be directly behind the mark on the cardboard. Try twisting and pressing on the pencil simultaneously to puncture the cardboard. Align the right angle on the cardboard with the other side of the window, and use the pencil to make a mark through the hole you punctured in it. Now you should have a mark on each side of the window to show you where to hang your adhesive hooks. The marks should be level. Take the adhesive strip off of the back of your hooks and press them firmly on the wall so the marks you made are lined up with the bottoms of the hooks. Make sure you press on the hooks for 30 seconds so the adhesive sticks. The adhesive on the hooks needs time to dry before it's secure. If you try to hang your curtains on the hooks too soon, they might fall down. The exact amount of time you should wait may vary depending on the kind of adhesive hooks you're using. Refer to the packaging for specific instructions. Your curtain rod should balance perfectly on the hooks. If it slides or tilts in one direction, the hooks might not be level. Try removing one of the hooks and checking to see that the marks are level. Run the curtain rod through the hoops at the top of your curtains and then hang it up again. Draw the curtains and let them sit for 1 hour to make sure the adhesive hooks can hold the weight. If your curtain falls, either the adhesive didn't fully stick to the wall or your curtain may be too heavy for the hooks. Consider buying higher-weight capacity hooks, or use 2 adjacent hooks on each side to balance the weight a little better.\nSummary:", "output_text": "Purchase adhesive hooks that can hold the weight of your curtains.

{"input_text": "Provide a summary with about two sentences for the following article:\nThe symbols at the beginning of the staff lines on a piece of sheet music show you how to play the song. Following the clef symbol to identify the treble or bass clef, you'll see the key signature and time signature.  The key signature indicates the key in which the song is played. If it's a key signature other than C major, it will contain sharps or flats somewhere. Those sharps or flats are noted at the beginning of the piece of music. The key signature means that every time you play that note throughout the piece, you'll play the sharp or flat indicated rather than the non-accidental note. For example, the G Major scale includes an F sharp, so for the G Major key signature you'd see a sharp sign (#) over the staff line that represents the F note. A major chord is the simplest type of chord you can play. It's a 3-note chord made up of the first, third, and fifth notes on the scale of the root note. Other chords involve making a change to the major chord.  You can start with a C major chord, since it's perhaps the easiest. Find the C key on your piano, then skip a white key and place another finger on the third key. Skip another white key and place a third finger on the fifth key. Play these 3 notes at the same time and you have a C Major chord. Applying the same theory, keep your hand in the same position but slide over one key to the D key on the piano. Notice where your fingers now fall. They should be positioned over the D, the F sharp, and the A. If you play these 3 notes together, you're playing a D Major chord. A minor chord is played the same as a major chord, except that instead of playing the middle note, or third note of the scale, you play the key to its immediate left, or one half-step lower. All minor chords are built the same way.  For example, for a C Major chord, you would play C, E, G, but for C minor you would play C, E-flat, G. You can follow this theory to form all the minor chords the same way you formed all the major chords. Seventh chords get their name from the fact that you're playing 4 notes in the chord, with the fourth note being the seventh note in the root note's scale.  For the major seventh chord, you simply play the first, third, fifth, and seventh notes of the major scale. For C Major Seventh, for example, notated as \"CM7\" or \"Cmaj7,\" you would play C-E-G-B. For any seventh chord that isn't a major seventh, you want to lower the seventh note a half-step. For example, C7 would be C-E-G-B flat. C minor 7, abbreviated \"Cm7,\" is a C-minor chord plus the lowered seventh note: C-E flat-G-B flat. A suspended chord has an unfinished sound, because you replace the third note of the major scale with the fourth note. To remember this, think of suspending your finger over the third note and dropping it further over on the fourth.  Ultimately, you're playing a regular major chord, except instead of playing the first, third, and fifth notes of the scale, you're playing the first, fourth, and fifth notes. Suspended chords may be represented on chord charts with the abbreviation \"sus\" (short for \"suspended\") or with the number 4 following the root note (to indicate you play the major chord with the fourth note instead of the third). Once you understand the theory behind the different chords and how they relate to the major chords, you can combine different variations to create more complex chords.  For example, you can create a suspended seventh chord by combining a suspended chord with a seventh chord. Play the fourth note of the major scale instead of the third, and then play the lowered seventh note. All 4 notes played together will be a suspended seventh chord.

If you cannot get the concrete trucks in a position to pour their payload directly into your forms, consider hiring a concrete pumping contractor to place the material for you.  You can also rent a piece of equipment with a front bucket, such as a skid steer, tractor, or a mechanical-engine powered wheelbarrow to make the job easier. For smaller driveways, a wheelbarrow will likely suffice. the slab as desired. You will want to get the surface as flat (note, this does not mean level) as possible to avoid bird baths, or standing water, on it. The driveway may slope, but should still be flat.  Not all driveways are level, but the surface should be fairly flat. You can use a hand trowel to make the surface evenly flat. Concrete will contract as it dries, which can result in cracking. Avoid this by using wood or plastic \u201czip strips\u201d to add 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep \u201ccracks\u201d or cuts in the concrete every 4 feet (1.2 m) or so.  If you let the concrete dry too much, you may need to use a specialized saw to cut contraction joints in, so it\u2019s best to do it early. Make sure you seperate the contraction joints by the same distance to keep the driveway looking uniform. Perfectly smooth concrete may make it difficult for your vehicle to get traction, especially in wet conditions. Drag a broom or a burlap sack along the concrete as its drying to create a textured surface your tires can grip.  This step must be done while the concrete is still damp enough to accept the texture. Broom the concrete in the direction you want your driveway to drain if there is a slope. . This is done by creating a moisture retaining barrier on the concrete's surface, either with a layer of plastic sheeting or by applying a chemical curing compound to prevent the concrete from drying out too quickly.  You should protect your concrete drive from extreme weather conditions for at least 3-7 days. Do not park your vehicle on the driveway until it has cured. The first time you park your vehicle on the driveway, lookout for signs of cracking or crumbling. If some cracks do appear, you may be able to repair them. You can then remove the wooden framing you built for the pour.  Be sure the concrete is completely cured before parking a vehicle on it, otherwise you may damage the concrete. To be safe, wait a minimum of three days for the concrete to cure.\nSummary:", "output_text": "To pour a concrete driveway, you will need to:\n\n1.

{"input_text": "Provide a summary with about two sentences for the following article:\nA fitted tank top with a high crew neckline can look lovely when paired with a cardigan sweater or fitted denim jacket. Add style to your look by choosing one with a fun print or embellishments at the collar. If you fall in love with a top or dress that has a deep v-neck or low square neckline, do not despair. A plain camisole or one with feminine lace detailing at the neck can transform that garment into something that will work with your modest wardrobe. Many camisoles have adjustable straps, so you can extend the neckline of the camisole to cover up any cleavage or uncomfortable amounts of skin. Think shawls, denim jackets, leather jackets, cardigan sweaters, blazers, military-style jackets, and more. The more variety you have in your outerwear, the more looks you can create. Outerwear is great for layering over pieces with low-cut backs or skinny straps. If you want to wear a dress or skirt, but worry that the hemline might be a bit too short, compensate by wearing something beneath it. Skinny jeans and leggings work well for many pieces. Be aware that many leggings may still look immodest, however, since they have a tendency to sculpt your body. To avoid this, only wear leggings with a skirt that covers your rear and most of your thighs. Do not wear super-short mini skirts that reveal everything the moment you sit down.\nSummary:", "output_text": "Wear a cute tank top beneath a nice sweater or jacket.

{"input_text": "Provide a summary with about two sentences for the following article:\nDepending on your budget and how many keepsakes you will need to purchase, there are many great ideas that can be customized to commemorate the founding of your company.  Branded apparel, a desk clock engraved with the company name and anniversary year, or a mug with your company logo might make great keepsakes to show your employees or stakeholders that they are appreciated. If you have a large budget and a production department in your company, you could even make a company history book or a short documentary to distribute to your employees. One way to give back to a community for a successful year of business is to give a donation, spend time in volunteer work, or make improvements to a local public space.  Consider giving your employees an optional day of volunteer service in the community to do a group project. You can work with groups like your local food bank, Habitat for Humanity, or your local parks service for day-long projects. Perhaps you would like to create some type of monument for your corporation that will stand the test of time.  A park bench, new playground equipment, or even trees planted along a freeway can be erected with a plaque specifying that it was donated on behalf of your company's anniversary. A time capsule is a great way to make a ceremony feel special and gives you something to look forward to in future years. It is also a great way to get employees involved in the ceremony.  You might put in items that represent each year of the company's history, each department in the company, or each employee (for a smaller company). Hold a company-wide ceremony to put items into the capsule and reminisce about the founding of the company and its vision going forward.\nSummary:", "output_text": "Give your employees and/or stakeholders a keepsake.

To reduce the potential for unintended intrathecal (spinal) administration, which causes death or severe neurological injury, FDA is working with drug application holders to remove instructions for preparation of these drugs by syringe and to recommend preparation in intravenous infusion bags only. \nIn 2007, the World Health Organization issued an alert about medication errors related to accidental intrathecal injection of vinca alkaloids. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices has published multiple reports about these wrong route-of-administration medication errors that resulted in adverse outcomes. In response, FDA has twice strengthened safety warnings in labeling for vinca alkaloids to warn against intrathecal administration and emphasize the products are for intravenous administration only. As published data suggests that dispensing vinca alkaloids prepared in intravenous bags reduces the risk of medication errors due to erroneous intrathecal administration, FDA is taking action to remove instructions for preparing vinca alkaloids in a syringe from the prescribing information for vinca alkaloids. The updated prescribing information for vinca alkaloids will only contain instructions for health care professionals to prepare these drugs in intravenous infusion bags.\nOn January 24, 2020, FDA approved labeling changes for the brand name Navelbine (vinorelbine tartrate injection) that removed instructions for preparing it in a syringe, and drug companies are required to update generic vinorelbine product labeling to match the brand name labeling. Vinorelbine tartrate injection is indicated to treat patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and, in combination with cisplatin, for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.\nOn January 14, 2021, the agency removed instructions for preparing vincristine sulfate injection in a syringe.
